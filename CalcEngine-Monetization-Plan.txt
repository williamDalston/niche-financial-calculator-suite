AFFILIATE PLACEMENT RULES
---------------------------

  That's the moment of highest intent — user just saw "$2,847/month"
  and you show them how to lower it.
- Maximum 2 affiliate CTAs per page (one below results, one in editorial).
- CTAs must be contextual to the calculator. Never show mortgage ads on a
  tip calculator.
- Style affiliate CTAs as native-looking recommendation cards that match
  the design system. Never use banner-style ads for affiliates.
- Conversion rates on contextual finance CTAs run 2–5%.
